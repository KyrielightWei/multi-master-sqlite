SQLite JDBC Driver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/xerial/sqlite-jdbc](https://badges.gitter.im/xerial/sqlite-jdbc.svg)](https://gitter.im/xerial/sqlite-jdbc?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
==================

SQLite JDBC, developed by [Taro L. Saito](http://www.xerial.org/leo), is a library for accessing and creating [SQLite](http://sqlite.org) database files in Java.

Our SQLiteJDBC library requires no configuration since native libraries for major OSs, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux etc., are assembled into a single JAR (Java Archive) file. The usage is quite simple; [download](https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/downloads)
our sqlite-jdbc library, then append the library (JAR file) to your class path.

See [the sample code](#usage).

What is different from Zentus' SQLite JDBC?
--------------------------------------------
The current sqlite-jdbc implementation is forked from [Zentus' SQLite JDBC driver](https://github.com/crawshaw/sqlitejdbc). We have improved it in two ways:

* Support major operating systems by embedding native libraries of SQLite, compiled for each of them.
* Remove manual configurations

In the original version, in order to use the native version of sqlite-jdbc, users had to set a path to the native codes (dll, jnilib, so files, etc.) through the command-line arguments,
e.g., `-Djava.library.path=(path to the dll, jnilib, etc.)`, or `-Dorg.sqlite.lib.path`, etc.
This process was error-prone and bothersome to tell every user to set these variables.
Our SQLiteJDBC library completely does away these inconveniences.

Another difference is that we are keeping this SQLiteJDBC library up-to-date to
the newest version of SQLite engine, because we are one of the hottest users of
this library. For example, SQLite JDBC is a core component of
[UTGB (University of Tokyo Genome Browser) Toolkit](http://utgenome.org/), which
is our utility to create personalized genome browsers.

Usage
============
SQLite JDBC is a library for accessing SQLite databases through the JDBC API. For the general usage of JDBC, see [JDBC Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/index.html) or [Oracle JDBC Documentation](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-136101.html).

1.  Download sqlite-jdbc-(VERSION).jar from the [download page](https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/downloads) (or by using [Maven](#using-sqlitejdbc-with-maven2))
then append this jar file into your classpath.
2.  Open a SQLite database connection from your code. (see the example below)

* More usage examples are available at [Usage](Usage.md)
* Usage Example (Assuming `sqlite-jdbc-(VERSION).jar` is placed in the current directory)

```
> javac Sample.java
> java -classpath ".;sqlite-jdbc-(VERSION).jar" Sample   # in Windows
or
> java -classpath ".:sqlite-jdbc-(VERSION).jar" Sample   # in Mac or Linux
name = leo
id = 1
name = yui
id = 2
```    

**Sample.java**

```java
    import java.sql.Connection;
    import java.sql.DriverManager;
    import java.sql.ResultSet;
    import java.sql.SQLException;
    import java.sql.Statement;

    public class Sample
    {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        Connection connection = null;
        try
        {
          // create a database connection
          connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:sample.db");
          Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
          statement.setQueryTimeout(30);  // set timeout to 30 sec.

          statement.executeUpdate("drop table if exists person");
          statement.executeUpdate("create table person (id integer, name string)");
          statement.executeUpdate("insert into person values(1, 'leo')");
          statement.executeUpdate("insert into person values(2, 'yui')");
          ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery("select * from person");
          while(rs.next())
          {
            // read the result set
            System.out.println("name = " + rs.getString("name"));
            System.out.println("id = " + rs.getInt("id"));
          }
        }
        catch(SQLException e)
        {
          // if the error message is "out of memory",
          // it probably means no database file is found
          System.err.println(e.getMessage());
        }
        finally
        {
          try
          {
            if(connection != null)
              connection.close();
          }
          catch(SQLException e)
          {
            // connection close failed.
            System.err.println(e.getMessage());
          }
        }
      }
    }
```    


How to Specify Database Files
-----------------------------

Here is an example to select a file `C:\work\mydatabase.db` (in Windows)

    Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:C:/work/mydatabase.db");


A UNIX (Linux, Mac OS X, etc) file `/home/leo/work/mydatabase.db`

    Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:/home/leo/work/mydatabase.db");



How to Use Memory Databases
---------------------------
SQLite supports on-memory database management, which does not create any database files.
To use a memory database in your Java code, get the database connection as follows:

    Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite::memory:");


## Configuration

sqlite-jdbc extracts a native library for your OS to the directory specified by `java.io.tmpdir` JVM property. To use another directory, set `org.sqlite.tmpdir` JVM property to your favorite path.

Download
========
Download the latest version of SQLiteJDBC from the [downloads page](https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/downloads).


Beta Release
------------
The early releases (beta) of sqlite-jdbc with some advanced features are available
from [here](https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/downloads)

*   The old releases are still available from [here](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/), but the site might be closed in future.

Supported Operating Systems
===========================
Since sqlite-jdbc-3.6.19, the natively compiled SQLite engines will be used for
the following operating systems:

*   Windows (Windows, x86 architecture, x86_64)
*   Mac OS X x86_64 (Support for SnowLeopard (i386) has been deprecated)
*   Linux x86, x86_64, arm (v5, v6, v7 and for android), ppc64

In the other OSs not listed above, the pure-java SQLite is used. (Applies to versions before 3.7.15)

If you want to use the native library for your OS, [build the source from scratch.


How does SQLiteJDBC work?
-------------------------
Our SQLite JDBC driver package (i.e., `sqlite-jdbc-(VERSION).jar`) contains three
types of native SQLite libraries (`sqlite-jdbc.dll`, `sqlite-jdbc.jnilib`, `sqlite-jdbc.so`),
each of them is compiled for Windows, Mac OS and Linux. An appropriate native library
file is automatically extracted into your OS's temporary folder, when your program
loads `org.sqlite.JDBC` driver.

Using SQLiteJDBC with Maven2
============================
If you are familiar with [Maven2](http://maven.apache.org), add the following XML
fragments into your pom.xml file. With those settings, your Maven will automatically download our SQLiteJDBC library into your local Maven repository, since our sqlite-jdbc libraries are synchronized with the [Maven's central repository](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/).

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.xerial</groupId>
          <artifactId>sqlite-jdbc</artifactId>
          <version>(version)</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

To use snapshot/pre-release versions, add the following repository to your Maven settings:
* Pre-release repository: <https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases>
* Snapshot repository: <https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots>

### Hint for maven-shade-plugin

You may need to add shade plugin transformer to solve `No suitable driver found for jdbc:sqlite:` issue.
```xml
<transformer
	implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.AppendingTransformer">
	<resource>META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver</resource>
</transformer>
```

Using SQLiteJDBC with Tomcat6 Web Server
========================================

(The following note is no longer necessary since sqlite-jdbc-3.8.7)

Do not include sqlite-jdbc-(version).jar in WEB-INF/lib folder of your web application
package, since multiple web applications hosted by the same Tomcat server cannot
load the sqlite-jdbc native library more than once. That is the specification of
JNI (Java Native Interface). You will observe `UnsatisfiedLinkError` exception with
the message "no SQLite library found".

Work-around of this problem is to put `sqlite-jdbc-(version).jar` file into `(TOMCAT_HOME)/lib`
directory, in which multiple web applications can share the same native library
file (.dll, .jnilib, .so) extracted from this sqlite-jdbc jar file.

If you are using Maven for your web application, set the dependency scope as 'provided',
and manually put the SQLite JDBC jar file into (TOMCAT_HOME)/lib folder.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.xerial</groupId>
        <artifactId>sqlite-jdbc</artifactId>
        <version>(version)</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
